# Captive Portal
A captive portal designed for guests to login and create a user account.

First, you'll have to clone this repo.
```git clone https://github.com/bwithe/captiveportal```

Then run ```python3 server.py```

You will be prompted for IP address, and Port that you want the captive portal to run on. 

You can press enter for the default settings.

All usernames and passwords will be stored in clear text in the ```users.txt```

I will update the script to hash the passwords.
