# Captive Portal

## Disclaimer
Not meant for illegal use. I am not resposible for the outcomes of your use case.

## Decription
I was working on a way to create and capture usernames and passwords for those who authenticated to a network. This would allow a user to register and get to a welcome page. In future updates, it could be forwarded elsewhere. 

Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/bwithe/captiveportal
```

Start the server:
- You will be prompted to input the IP address and port for the captive portal. Press Enter for default settings.
```
cd captiveportal
python3 server.py
```

Please note that all usernames and passwords are currently stored in clear text in the **_users.txt_** file. A future update will include password hashing for enhanced security.
